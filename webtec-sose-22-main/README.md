## Description

We are truly **natural** - without compromise
Care for you and the World
 
We are Pomeli! The natural cosmetics brand created and made in Germany that cares for the environment, the planet, animal welfare and, of course, you. We don't do it simply because it's trendy, we do it because we've loved it for over 30 years.

Since environmental protection has always been close to our hearts, we did not have to think long about whether we wanted to participate.
Everything we do should highlight your natural beauty, be fun and protect our planet. Because protecting nature simply makes you beautiful! So how do we do it all? We roll out the green carpet for you: Genuine, uncomplicated natural cosmetics with natural ingredients and certified according to the established quality standard #NATRUE. To achieve this, we use selected organic plant-based raw materials and purely natural fragrances. After all, real beauty comes from nature!

We don't just want to make you more beautiful with our products, we want to make the world a little better. There is a lot to do on the way to a more sustainable life. So many screws we can turn to be extra gentle with our planet. We take a holistic approach that extends to the careful selection of our ingredients, packaging materials, as well as environmentally friendly production processes, making a positive contribution to our environment. We live sustainability in line with our motto "Care for you and the world." It starts in the heart of Germany, from where we develop and manufacture our to certified natural cosmetics.

## Visuals
Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.



## Usage
Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.

## Support
Tell people where they can go to for help. It can be any combination of an issue tracker, a chat room, an email address, etc.
