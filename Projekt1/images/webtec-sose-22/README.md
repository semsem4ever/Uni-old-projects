*We are truly **natural** ðŸŒ¿- without compromise
Care for you and the WorldðŸŒŽ*
 
We are POMELODI! The natural cosmetics brand created and made in Germany ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª  that cares for the environment, the planet, animal welfare and, of course, you. We don't do it simply because it's trendy, we do it because we've loved it for over 30 years.

Since environmental protection has always been close to our hearts, we did not have to think long about whether we wanted to participate.
Everything we do should highlight your natural beauty, be fun and protect our planet. Because protecting nature simply makes you beautiful! So how do we do it all? We roll out the green carpet for you: Genuine, uncomplicated natural cosmetics with natural ingredients and certified according to the established quality standard #NATRUE. To achieve this, we use selected organic plant-based raw materials and purely natural fragrances. After all, real beauty comes from nature!ðŸŒ¿

We don't just want to make you more beautiful with our products, we want to make the world a little better. There is a lot to do on the way to a more sustainable life. So many screws we can turn to be extra gentle with our planet. We take a holistic approach that extends to the careful selection of our ingredients, packaging materials, as well as environmentally friendly production processes, making a positive contribution to our environment. We live sustainability in line with our motto "Care for you and the world." It starts in the heart of Germany, from where we develop and manufacture our to certified natural cosmetics.
